PicWhere
========

A photo guessing "game"

[Try it on rawgithub](http://rawgithub.com/mdonahoe/picwhere/master/picwhere.html)


1. Generates a random Lat/Long pair (very naively).
2. Uses the Panoramio API to grab a nearby photo.
3. Displays that photo fullscreen.
4. Upon-click, uses the Google Maps API to show the location on a map.
5. Repeat!


#Suggestions

* Choose a random photo faster and more intelligently,
perhaps by using a different Panoramio API than proximity search.

* Let the user record their guess, or choose from a list
